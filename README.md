YouTravel is a video-based application that allows users to watch videos that highlight useful information about cities you are about to travel to. Users can select a city they are about to travel to and watch videos based on the food, cultural sites, or leisure activities that city is known for. Users can also upload their own videos, as well as comment on other users' videos.
